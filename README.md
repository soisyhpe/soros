## Overview

This project is a distributed key-value store system that facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs across a network of nodes using peer-to-peer communication. The system aims to provide fault tolerance by distributing data across multiple nodes in a decentralized manner.

## Features

- Distributed Storage: Data is distributed across multiple nodes in the network, providing fault tolerance.
- Peer-to-Peer Communication: Nodes communicate with each other directly to share data and coordinate operations.
- Concurrency Control: Mechanisms for handling concurrent read and write operations to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## Architecture

The system consists of multiple nodes interconnected in a peer-to-peer network. Each node is responsible for storing a portion of the key-value pairs and coordinating with other nodes for data retrieval. An authority server is also present to assist in directing clients to the correct node for their data.

### Components

- Node: Represents an individual server or peer in the distributed network. Each node is responsible for storing a subset of the data, processing requests, and communicating with other nodes.
- Communication Layer: Facilitates communication between nodes using a peer-to-peer protocol. This layer handles message routing, synchronization, and error handling.
- Authority Server: Provides information about the location of data, assisting clients in locating the appropriate node for key-value operations.
